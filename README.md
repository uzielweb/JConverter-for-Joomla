JConverter-for-Joomla
=====================

JConverter is a Joomla 1.5 component for converting a Wordpress blog to Joomla. It imports posts, pages, categories, users and even links from Wordpress to Joomla. Its meant to be a developer tool so it's not very user friendly but it does the job well.

In version 0.3, support for importing comments from Wordpress into JomComment was included. 

Roadmap
=======

- Make it Joomla 2.5 compatible
- Fix users password encryption issue
- As of now, it supports import from wordpress only when both wordpress and joomla database on same server. Support for remote need to be added.
